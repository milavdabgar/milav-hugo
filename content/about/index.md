## About This Site

PlanetMilav is where I share knowledge and experiences that I find useful. I write blog posts when I discover something worth sharing, and use this space to document my personal explorations. This helps both myself and others who might encounter similar challenges in the future, eliminating the need to search extensively for solutions.

As a Lecturer in Electronics and Communication at Government Polytechnic, Palanpur, much of the study materials shared here are at the Diploma level.

While I welcome suggestions to improve content quality, please note that my primary focus is on content rather than presentation. I'm not a professional web developer - my goal is to document and share knowledge effectively.
